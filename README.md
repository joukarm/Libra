##  Integrated Material Balance Software

"PROSPECT" is a software solution for analyzing petroleum production data using decline curve analysis methods such as Arps, Blasingame, NPI, etc.
An interactive interface is provided by PROSPECT to assist engineers in the manual curve-fitting process, type-curve matching, and plotting semilog trend-lines. In addition, PROSPECT utilizes Artificial Intelligence (Genetic Algorithm) to automate the type-curve matching process and forecast production data accordingly.

I was responsible for the development of both the back-end and the front-end of PROSPECT. Below you will find several snapshots of the solution:
