# Libra
##  Integrated Material Balance Software

Using C#, I have developed the interface of "Libra" , which has an intricate and interactive GUI. Libra is an internal tool for the analysis of Material Balance. In addition to conventional reservoirs, it can also be used in fractured reservoirs. Libra enables the creation of several objects such as fluid, rock, saturation, sector, etc., as well as the creation of different sectors using the defined objects, which can then be used to run a single or multi-sector model and begin the analysis.
Users of Libra have the ability to view results in a variety of powerful customizable charts and reports.
